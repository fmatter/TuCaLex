# Alleged cognates between Cariban and Tupian languages

Rodrigues, Aryon D. 1985. Evidence for Tupi-Carib relationships. In Manelis Klein, Harriet E. and Stark, Louisa R. (eds.), South American Indian languages, 371–404. University of Texas Press. presents evidence for relationships between Cariban and Tupían languages, due to both contact and shared inheritance.
Crucially, his list A contains 121 cognate sets with items intended to illustrate a deeper genealogical connection between the two families.
He does acknowledge the possibility of borrowing, but not of chance resemblance, and gives a list of cognate sets that are very solidly attested in both language families.
These items, represented by numbers, will be compared here.
Note that Rodriguez advises caution, due to the lack of knowledge about Cariban languages, and the resulting dearth of which these cognates are distributed in Cariban.

# Alleged cognates between Cariban and Tupian languages

[Rodrigues 1985](#source-rodrigues1985evidence) presents evidence for relationships between Cariban and Tupían languages.
Among other things, he presents three lists of cognate forms between the two families, arguing that they are due to a) shared inheritance between Cariban and Tupían, b) contact between Proto-Tupi-Guarani and "North Amazonian Cariban", c) recent contact of Cariban languages with Nhengatu or some other TG language.
Parts of these lists were modelled as a [CLDF dataset](cldf) and visualized with [cldfviz](https://github.com/cldf/cldfviz/).

## List A
This list contains 121 shared cognate sets which are argued to be likely due to shared inheritance from a common ancestor.
Rodrigues does acknowledge the possibility of borrowing, but not of chance resemblance, and gives a list of cognate sets that are particularly solidly attested in both language families.
Only this sublist was investigated, as it suffices to show that no genealogical connection can be established based on these particularly strong cognate sets.
Cariban is mostly represented by Hixkaryána, Waiwai, Pemon, Galibi Carib, Bakairí, Macushi, and Tupían by Tupinambá and Tuparí.
These data were augmented with additional cognate words from both families, as well as reconstructible forms.
In most cases, simply comparing the reconstructed Proto-Tupi-Guarani and Proto-Cariban forms suffices to show that the words are, in fact, not even cognate.
Rather, the perceived similarity is mostly due to chance resemblance.


### 21: 'father'



PC ‘father’, tentatively reconstructed as _*jumɨ_.

Tupian ‘father’. Incidentally, one of the forms with initial PT *Dj; lost in Tupari and reanalyzed in Aweti-Guarani. See [TuLaR](https://tular.clld.org/cognatesets/5755).

### 25: 'fat'
Wayana _kap-hak_ ‘fat’ is _kaphak_ in [de Goeje 1946](#source-degoeje1946wayana); the segmentation was perhaps done to create the appearance of a TG-like form _kap_. The actual segmentation is _ka-phak_ ([Tavares 2005](#source-wayanatavares2005)).




PC *_katɨ_ ‘fat’. Note that some languages reinterpreted the final syllable as a PERT marker.

Tupian ‘fat’. It is not clear if all forms are cognate.

# Alleged cognates between Cariban and Tupian languages


[Rodrigues 1985](#source-rodrigues1985evidence) presents evidence for relationships between Cariban and Tupían languages, due to both contact and shared inheritance.
Crucially, his list A contains 121 cognate sets with items intended to illustrate a deeper genealogical connection between the two families.
He does acknowledge the possibility of borrowing, but not of chance resemblance, and gives a list of cognate sets that are very solidly attested in both language families.
These items, represented by numbers, will be compared here.
Note that Rodrigues advises caution, due to the lack of knowledge about Cariban languages, and the resulting dearth of which these cognates are distributed in Cariban.

## 25: 'fat'
Wayana _kap-hak_ 'fat' is _kaphak_ in the original source; the likely intention was to create appearance of a TG-like form _kap_. The actual segmentation is _ka-phak_.



PC *_katɨ_ ‘fat’. Some languages reinterpreted the final syllable as a PERT marker.
